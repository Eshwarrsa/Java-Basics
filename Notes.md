# Java:
&nbsp; Java is a general purpose compiler language which is known for its Object Oriented Programming and its stability and platform independence and its runtime polymorphism. Java is used to develop a end to end application due to its protability. Java is strictly typed programing language. Java is not fully object oriented language because of it primitive data type. Java is like compile one time and run anywhere type program. We can run its byte code where ever we have JVM. Java is developed by James Gosling in Sun Microsystems. Later it was bought by Oracle. Recent versions are maintained by oracle. 

# Tokens:
&nbsp; Tokens are the part of the program which helps the java compiler to identify the part of program. Tokens are the building block of java. They are several type of tokens. They are:
* keyword
* identifiers
* literals
* operators
* seperator
* comments

## keyword:
&nbsp; keywords are the reserved word in java which has its own functnallity. It cannot be used for any other purpose. Some of the example are `class, public, static, void, boolean, int etc.,`.

## Identifiers:
&nbsp; Identifiers are the single character or a group of character which represents the memory location of a primitive value or memory address of non primitive value. They are certain rule to create identifiers. They are:
* Identifiers can have all upper case, lower case, digits and special character which are `_` and `$`. 
* Identifiers cannot have other special character except `_` and `$`. 
* keywords cannot be used as identifiers. 
* The identifier cannot start with an digit. 

## literals:
&nbsp; Literals are the constant value that is declared without any identifier representation. These cannot be modified after used. It is literlly we can use one time. For Example:
```java
System.out.println("Hii");
```

## Operators:
&nbsp; Operator can be defined as the symbols that conducts a specific task with its operands. According to the operands we can classify operators into three. They are:
* Uniary Operator
* Binary Operator
* Ternery Operator

&nbsp; According to the operation we can classify operator into five types. They are:
* Arithmetic Operator
* Relational Operator
* Logical Operator
* Bitwise Operator
* Ternery operator

### Arithmetic Operator:
&nbsp; Arithmetic Operator are the operator which are used to perform some basic arithmetic operation. They are seven types of arithmetic operator:
* `++`var and var`++`
* `--`var and var`--`
* var1 `+` var2
* var1 `-` var2
* var1 `*` var2
* var1 `/` var2
* var1 `%` var2

&nbsp; Except `++` and `--` other operators take two operands. `++` and `--` takes only one arguments. These operators can be used with `short, byte, int, long, float, double` only. The `+` is a overloaded operator where it is used to cancatenate two string also. 

### Relational Operator:
&nbsp; Relational Operator are the operator which compares the two operands and returns the boolean value accordingly. Some of the relational operator are:
* `<=`
* `>=`
* `>`
* `<`
* `==`
* `!=`

### Logical Operator:
&nbsp; Logical operator are the operator which takes two operands as boolean and also returns the boolean value. There are three logical operator:
* `&&` --> and
* `||` --> or
* `!` --> not

### Bitwise Operator:
&nbsp; Bitwise operator are the operator which takes two operands has numbers as input and return same datatype as output. Some of the bitwise operator are:
* `&` --> and
* `|` --> or
* `^` --> xor

### Ternery Operator:
&nbsp; Ternery operator are the operator which has three operands according to the condition given in first opernds any one of the operands of second or third will be executed. The first operand should return boolean value. If the value is true the second operand will be executed otherwise the third operand will be executed. The syntax is:
`var1 ? var2 : var3`. 

## Seperator:
&nbsp; Seperators are some symbols or brackets which seperates the execution of the code. These decides the scope of the code should be executed according to calling it. The property of certain symbol are:
* `;` --> Tells the end of each line of code. 
* `{}` --> Decides the scope of the method, class, blocks.

## Comments:
&nbsp; Comments are the non executable lines which makes us to maintain notes or explanation about the code. We can do comments in two ways. They are:
* `/*----*/` --> Multiline commenting
* `//---` --> Single line commenting
