# Java:
&nbsp; Java is a general purpose compiler language which is known for its Object Oriented Programming and its stability and platform independence and its runtime polymorphism. Java is used to develop a end to end application due to its protability. Java is strictly typed programing language. Java is not fully object oriented language because of it primitive data type. Java is like compile one time and run anywhere type program. We can run its byte code where ever we have JVM. Java is developed by James Gosling in Sun Microsystems. Later it was bought by Oracle. Recent versions are maintained by oracle. 

# Tokens:
&nbsp; Tokens are the part of the program which helps the java compiler to identify the part of program. Tokens are the building block of java. They are several type of tokens. They are:
* keyword
* identifiers
* literals
* operators
* seperator
* comments

## keyword:
&nbsp; keywords are the reserved word in java which has its own functnallity. It cannot be used for any other purpose. Some of the example are `class, public, static, void, boolean, int etc.,`.

## Identifiers:
&nbsp; Identifiers are the single character or a group of character which represents the memory location of a primitive value or memory address of non primitive value. They are certain rule to create identifiers. They are:
* Identifiers can have all upper case, lower case, digits and special character which are `_` and `$`. 
* Identifiers cannot have other special character except `_` and `$`. 
* keywords cannot be used as identifiers. 
* The identifier cannot start with an digit. 

## literals:
&nbsp; Literals are the constant value that is declared without any identifier representation. These cannot be modified after used. It is literlly we can use one time. For Example:
```java
System.out.println("Hii");
```
